# Suzuki-Miyaura-Automation

## Workflow of Optimization Campaign
### 1. Execution of Reaction by Chemspeed Platform and SFC Analysis
Both processes were performed using the specialized software AutoSuite for the Chemspeed platform.
### 2. Output of SFC Spectrum
Four spectrum files `***_result.csv` were generated by the SFC software.
### 3. Integration and Error Detection for SFC Spectrum
This was carried out by evaluate_objective.bat (a wrapper for evaluated_objective_2024_06_25.exe).
### 4. Decision of Next Experimental Conditions by Gaussian Process Regression
This was performed by decision_by_nimsos.bat (a wrapper for decision_by_nimsos_2024_06_21.exe). Four experiments were proposed, and the input file `input_for_chemspeed.csv` was generated.
### 5. Execution of Next Experimental Conditions
The AutoSuite system read the input file `input_for_chemspeed.csv` and executed the experiments accordingly.

## File IO in Automatic Experiment
- Chemspeed system
    - Input: `input_for_chemspeed.csv` (suggested 4 experimental conditions)
    - Output: `1st_result.csv`, `1st_profile.csv`, ..., `4th_profile.csv`, `4th_profile.csv` (resulted chromatograph and pressure profile of CO2 pump in SFC system)

- `evaluate_objective` program
    - Input: `1st_result.csv`, `1st_profile.csv`, ..., `4th_profile.csv`, `4th_profile.csv`
    - Output: writing objective to `candidates.csv` (table of all experimental conditions involving descriptors)
    - Setting file: `param.txt` (required parameters of quantitative analysis, e.g., wavelength, integration area, etc.)

- `decision_by_nimsos` program
    - Input: `candidates.csv`, `exp_table.csv` (table of expID, experimental conditions, and, symbolic representation of each conditions)
    - Output: `input_for_chemspeed.csv`
    - Setting file: `settings.txt`

## 1. Input to Chemspeed
An AutoSuite program of Chemspeed can read CSV file as input. The file `input_for_chemspeed.csv` is an actual input to the Chemspeed system. This file has a header in 1 row and 4 experimental conditions in 4 rows. Each row includes 3 integer numbers delimited by a comma, which are the reagent number of ligands (1-15), bases (1-10), and solvents (1-10). Since the second batch, this file is automatically updated by the `decision_by_nimsos.bat` script.

## 2. Execution and Analysis of suggested experiments
Chemspeed system executes the suggested 4 experiments and their analysis. After the analysis, the SFC system outputs 2 files, `1st_result.csv` and `1st_profile.csv` for 1st experiment.
`1st_result.csv` is an actual chromatogram, and `1st_profile.csv` is the pressure profile of a CO2 pump in the SFC system.
`2nd_result.csv` and `2nd_profile.csv`, `3rd_result.csv` and `3rd_profile.csv`, and `4th_result.csv` and `4th_profile.csv` are also outputted as same way.
These 8 files are transferred to `C:\robotcsv` directory by SFC syste

## 3. Integration and Error Detection
An `evaluate_objective` program writes 4 objective values of experiments in `candidates.csv.`
- Parameters of `param.txt`
    - STD_MW: molecular weight of standard
    - SUB_MW: molecular weight of the substrate
    - MV_LEN: wavelength for integration
    - STD_INI: starting point of integration of STD
    - STD_FIN: ending point of integration of STD
    - P1_INI: starting point of integration of p1 (starting material, compound 1)
    - P1_FIN: starting point of integration of p1 (starting material, compound 1)
    - P1_SLP: slope of the calibration curve
    - P2_INI: starting point of integration of p2 (starting material, product 3)
    - P2_FIN: starting point of integration of p2 (starting material, product 3)
    - P2_SLP: slope of the calibration curve
    - P3_INI: starting point of integration of p3 (starting material, by-product 4)
    - P3_FIN: starting point of integration of p3 (starting material, by-product 4)
    - P3_SLP: slope of the calibration curve
    - STD_WT: actual weight of STD
    - SUB_WT: actual weight of the substrate
    - BL_AVE: area of baseline correction
    - LOW_PS: lower limit of pressure of SFC system
    - UPR_PS: upper limit of pressure of SFC system

## 4. Training and Evaluation by Gaussian Process Regression
Training and evaluation during the optimization campaign using Gaussian Process Regression were conducted with the PHYSBO optimizer, which was accessed through the NIMS-OS library (now renamed NIMO). In the optimization campaign, all experimental data obtained up to that point were used for training, and hyperparameter tuning was automatically performed in each batch by PHYSBO. Thompson Sampling was selected as the acquisition function for Bayesian optimization. Please refer to the code `decision_by_nimsos_2024_06_21.py` and the PHYSBO library documentation for more technical details.
